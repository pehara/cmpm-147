                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This experiment aims to create an infinite snowy world with variations in terrain and interactive elements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>This experiment uses Perlin noise to generate terrain height values. Based on these values, different colors represent snowy plains, hills, and mountains. Icy lakes are randomly added to the terrain within a specific height range. Each tile reacts to clicks, changing its appearance.</p>
                <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A world seed is defined based on the input key using XXH hashing.</li>
                    <li>Each tile's height is determined using Perlin noise.</li>
                    <li>Different colors are assigned for snowy terrain based on height values.</li>
                    <li>Icy lakes are randomly added within a specific height range.</li>
                    <li>Clicking on tiles changes their appearance.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>For this project I was the sole contributor, I was able to generate this concept through the use of online resources and the code given to us. Reflectoing on my work I think I did a good job implementing a infinite snowy landscape that is pretty similar to real life. One of my lows of the experiment would be figuring out how to make a 3D terrain, I included a lot of my hurdles this time because I encountered a lot of challenges but I was able to ovecom them. My highw as when everything came together and my scene looked like what I had been envisioning. </p>
